balls[i][0] is x



have an array* of intervals which keep track of different powerup timers, have a function that starts up each different interval, and if(one of the timers>0){
	draw the icon and time left on the game screen
}


write a new function that gets triggered inside the draw function
make it check each of the powerup timer values in the powerupTimer Object, display any timers that are greater than zero


When you hit a powerup: 
	effect is put on
	resetPowerups("powerup") is called




fix a single powerup, see all steps that need to happen so that the powerup works properly so that it can be recreated and put all finished powerups into 1 function/area if possible, group intervals in 1 area, and timeouts in another

use powerupIntvs object and include all intervals in it.
