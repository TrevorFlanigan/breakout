balls[i].x is x



have an array* of intervals which keep track of different powerup timers, have a function that starts up each different interval, and if(one of the timers>0){
	draw the icon and time left on the game screen :D
}


write a new function that gets triggered inside the draw function
make it check each of the powerup timer values in the powerupTimer Object, display any timers that are greater than zero :D




Display the Ammo for C/T (Easy):D

Slow the Ball only once(easy):D

Reversing Dx's and Y's (Harder)
	Display olddy and olddx in console.log to help test
	use one ball to test
	:D


Give the balls summoned by multiball bricks a random negative dy and a random dx; make multiball summon 2 balls

reset button for after game ends using location.reload();
Make icons dynamic based off of brick size.
Make paddle dynamic as well.:D
Edit images to have transparent backgrounds. :D
